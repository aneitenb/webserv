# TEST COMMANDS
# curl -H "Host: example.com" http://127.0.0.1:8080/  # Should use specific IP config
# curl -H "Host: example.com" http://10.12.6.11:8080/  # Should use wildcard config: use "ifconfig" then use the ip next to "inet" under "enp4s0f0"

# ISSUE:
# returning the wrong home pages on the first curl command, and hanging on the second command until curl timeout
